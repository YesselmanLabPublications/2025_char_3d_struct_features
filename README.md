## Data Download
Make sure to download the data used in this project from [10.6084/m9.figshare.27880434](https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/50690154). Unzip this data and store it in the `data/` directory within the current project directory.


## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YesselmanLabPublications/2024_dms_3d_features.git
cd 2024_dms_3d_features

# Create a new conda environment
conda create --name dms_3d_features python=3.8

# Activate the conda environment
conda activate dms_3d_features

# if you need to install RNAfold
conda install -c bioconda viennarna

# Install the package
pip install . 

# Deactivate the conda environment to reset sometimes need to do this
conda deactivate
conda activate dms_3d_features

# Download the data from figshare
wget https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/58663213 -O data.zip
unzip data.zip

# Run the tests
# all should pass
pytest 
```

## Running the analysis 

### Generate motif data
processes the DMS data generated by rna-map and breaks constructs up into motifs
```bash
python dms_3d_features/cli.py generate-motif-data
```

### Generate 3D features
NOTE you must have 3DNA installed (http://forum.x3dna.org/site-announcements/download-instructions/) to run this script. 

```bash
python dms_3d_features/cli.py generate-pdb-features
```

## Figure generation

All figures are generated in jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/figures` directory.
